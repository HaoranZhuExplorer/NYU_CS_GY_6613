Steps:
Step1: Get familiar with pytorch  [on the way]
Step2: Understand the current solution [done]
Step3: Searching papers for Time Series Classification using Deep Learning. Paperwithcode/Google Scholar
Step4: Try to apply techniques illustrated in the above papers to my project



AutoML?
	haven't found a good platform


Try to apply muti-channel deep convoluntional neural network (MCDCNN)
